In the beginning of 2017 I decided to try and read as much Discworld novels as possible. (Besides the 25 book challenge that I set for myself)
My guess is that I will be able to read 10! As a motivation for myself, I decided to post the highlights I make while reading online.

The first book I have in paperback, so I can't give you my favorite quotes for that one, but for all the others I will post them here.
So, yesterday I did [Equal Rites](http://selketjah.github.io/2017/03/18/equal-rites-quotes/) and today I give you the highlights of the second book, [The Light Fantastic](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34506.The_Light_Fantastic).
(I know, wrong direction)

> ‘Have you ever heard of culture shock?’ he hissed. ‘What’s that?’ ‘It’s what happens when people spend five hundred years trying to get a stone circle to work properly and then someone comes up with a little book with a page for every day and little chatty bits saying things like “Now is a good time to plant broad beans” (p. 70)
<br>

> ‘Oh, yes,’ said Twoflower, to whom sarcasm was merely a seven letter word beginning with S. (p. 72)
<br>

> Cohen had heard of fighting fair, and had long ago decided he wanted no part of it. (p. 196) 
<br>

> ‘Inside every sane person there’s a madman struggling to get out,’ ... No one goes mad quicker than a totally sane person.’ (p. 221)
<br>

> The wizards were learning that while it was all very fine and impressive to have a set of gates that were locked by magic, it ought to have occurred to the builders to include some sort of emergency back-up device such as, for example, a pair of ordinary, unimpressive stout iron bolts. (p. 229)
<br>

> Sometimes things can fail to happen in quite impressive ways, but as far as non-events went this one just couldn’t compete. (pp. 263-264)
