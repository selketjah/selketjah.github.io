For the past 24 hours I have been told that, as a conference organisor:

* I should be careful about getting involved in US politics
* I am supposed to stay out of politics
* I shouldn't try to be "politically correct"
* I should remain apolitical
* etc...

I am tired of hearing that over and over again. So here is my answer:
* When I show compassion for my speakers, is seen as me being political,
* When I want to invite a wide range of speakers with different backgrounds, is me trying to be "politically correct",
* When I say 'Black Lives Matter' and people think I am making a political statement,
* When I want to support a good cause such as [@BlackGirlsCode](https://twitter.com/BlackGirlsCode) by asking to donate, is viewed as me "not being apolitical",

then there is something wrong with people thinking I am being political, not with me.

> Being apolitical means: not interested or involved in politics.

* How am I supposed to stay out of politics, when my speakers are affected by the protests in the United States?
* How am I supposed to ignore United States politics, when Belgian politicians started using their tactics, such as 'The war on drugs' to get votes?
* How am I supposed to say apolitical things, when they have abused the language I speak for their political agenda?
* How am I supposed to stay apolitical, when politicians tap into my hopes and dreams?
* How am I supposed to be apolitical when they try to tap into my fears?

If I have to stay away from politics, then politics has to stay away from me. Politics abuses **my** emotions, **my** values, **my** language, **my** gender, **my** culture, **my** identity for its own gain. There is no boundary it is not willing to cross, so I don't know how or where to draw a line anymore.

Politics is about us, our community, our lives. I am making a stand. Why arenâ€™t you?
