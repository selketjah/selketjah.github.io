During DDD Europe 2024, a fellow speaker asked me how I stayed so calm before and during my talks because they couldnt do that. My first instinct was "calm? I am not calm. I am extremely nervous." But then I started to think about it. The truth is, I am a lot calmer than I was at the beginning. There is a video out there of me talking about F# and Fable and you can just see how nervous I am. I finished 15min early because I was so nervous and I couldn't calm myself down during the talk. Safe to say, not one of my best performances. I am not only calmer, I am also better at public speaking in general. I consciously worked on my public speaking skills. So I decided to sit down and write what I did to get better.

My first talk was almost 9 years ago. I know, it would have been cooler if I wrote this next year, but alas. The topic was F# working together with other .NET languages (C# and VB.NET). It had a demo in it, where I coded in C# and VB.NET to show how easy/hard it was to use F# libraries. It was the first and last talk that ever had live coding in it...
There is a good reason for that: I don't enjoy talks where I have to code while everybody is staring at me. This brings me to my first advice:

# Do what makes you comfortable

I am don't enjoy live coding, Q&A's make me sweat, and being on a panel is 50 minutes of mental torture for me. So I am not doing those anymore. Maybe at some point I will decide to give it another go, because I have more experience. For now, I say no to those. Q&A's are more tricky, because not all conferences give you the option to opt out of them at the end of your talk. I do start making it clear at the beginning of my talk:"There will be no time for QA, but come find me after the talk if you have questions. I am here for the rest of the conference." Even when I announce it, and my timing is spot on, some MC's will still allow a few minutes for audience questions. it is a shitty thing to do and I would really like it if MC's did a better job at being an MC.

This is what I love: I love giving hands-on sessions, LOVE it. It looked way scarier than giving a talk. Just because something looks scary, doesn't mean that it is. What I am trying to say is this: the downside to this advice is that you have to do try different formats in order to understand if you are comfortable with them or not.  

# Talk about what you know

Some people find it very motivating to submit talks on topics they know nothing about. I am not one of those people. For any topic that I submit, I could go on stage right now and talk about it for 2 or 3 hours. I know a lot about software design, Domain-Driven Design, collaboration, and decision-making. So those are the things you will see me talking about right now. I don't have to worry about forgetting something, because I know this stuff.
