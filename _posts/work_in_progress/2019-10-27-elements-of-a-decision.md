# A decision maker

A `decision maker` is a person with the authority and the commitment to make a decision.

# A frame



# Alternatives/Options

We already touched alternatives in the [previous post](2019-10-17-what-is-a-decision.md)
Options are available actions that the decision maker can take that will lead them to a `different future`.
If you have multiple options, but all lead to the same outcome, than you have no decision to make, because it does not matter which one you pick.

# Preferences

A decision maker will have `preferences` about the options. This means that certain options are more desirable, because the outcomes of those options are more desirable.

If the decision maker does not prefer one option over the other, they don't care about the possible futures. This means that there is no decision to be made, because any option will do.


# Information

The linking of what the decision maker can do (options) with what they want to do (preference) is provided by `what they know`. What they know is called information.


# Logic

A `process` to derive the action we should take from what we can do (options), what we want to do (preferences), and what we know (information).
