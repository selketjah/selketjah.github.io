The word `decision` pops up very often in our day to day conversations, and that is not that surprising. Decisions form a very central role in our lives: we can easily sum up someones life by telling the sequence of decisions they made throughout it. We judge ourselves and other people by the decisions that we make:

* I can't believe they are moving in together, that is just a nightmare waiting to happen...
* You should ask your brother to go with when buying your car, he bought a really good one himself.
* ...

The sad thing is that most of us never really learn anything about making decisions. <!--more--> So a few years ago, when a friend onf mine told me that they actually taught this in certain courses

Let's start by trying to answer a very basic question: what exactly is a decision?

## What is a decision?

If I had to explain a decision to someone unfamiliar with the concept, this is what I would say:

```
You have to do something, and there a few options you could pick to do it and you need to pick just one of them.
```

Whether it is the best definition ever is debatable, but I think most of us would agree it is a good attempt to explain what a decision is. So how do other (more official) sources explain it?

According to [Cambridge dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/decision), a decision is:

```
Decision:
a choice that you make about something after thinking about several possibilities.
```

and here is another one, from the texbook [Foundations of Decision Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Decision-Analysis-Ronald-Howard/dp/0132336243/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3BHQUJF5YW9PC&keywords=foundations+of+decision+analysis&qid=1570889458&s=books&sprefix=foundations+of+deci%2Caps%2C234&sr=1-1):

```
Decision:
a choice between two or more alternatives that involves an irrevocable allocation of resources.
```

Although the definitions seem very different at first glance, they do have a couple of key concepts in common.

### Alternatives

To start with, the concept of `things you can select from` can be found in all three of the definitions. Whether it is called an `option`, a `possibility` or an `alternative`, they all try to express the same idea: there are multiple things available that you can choose from, or to use the definition of the textbook:

```
Alternatives/Options are available courses of action that the person believes would lead to different futures.
```

An option is defined here as something that will lead to a different future, which makes a lot of sense. If all your options have the same outcome, it doesn't matter which one you pick. When it doesn't matter which one you pick, you don't have a decision to make.

All three also give an indication that you have to boil the options down to one.
So, this implies that there is always more than one option available. This is true when you think about it in this way: not making a decision is always an option.
(We will get more into this in part II, making quality decisions)

### Irrevocable allocation of resources

The second part of the definition talks about `irrevocable allocation of resources`. What this means is that there is a cost in being wrong. Undoing your decision will cost to lose time, money or energy.
This is important to determine whether or not a person has made a decision. Think back on all those New Years resolutions... All those to-do's made on the first day of the year and most of them will never even start with the resolution. Declaring that you have made a decision is cheap, in order to actually make one, you need to put your money, euh, I mean resource, where your mouth is!


## A decision can be ...

... Easy or hard


What makes a decision easy or hard is how well informed you feel about the decision you have to make.
Picking your ice cream flavor can be labelled as an easy decision. 

... Reactive or proactive

... good or bad
