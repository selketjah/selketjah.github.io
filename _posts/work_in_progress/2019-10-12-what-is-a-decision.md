The word `decision` pops up very often in our day to day conversations, and that is not that surprising. Decisions form a very central role in our lives: we can easily sum up someones life by telling the sequence of decisions they made throughout it. We judge ourselves and other people by the decisions that we make:

* I can't believe they are moving in together, that is just a nightmare waiting to happen...
* You should ask your brother to go with when buying your car, he bought a really good one himself.
* ...

The sad thing is that most of us never really learn anything about making decisions. <!--more--> So a few years ago, when a friend onf mine told me that they actually taught this in certain courses

Let's start by trying to answer a very basic question: what exactly is a decision?

## What is a decision?

If I had to explain a decision to someone unfamiliar with the concept, this is what I would say:

```
You have to do something, and there a few options you could pick to do it and you need to pick just one of them.
```

Whether it is the best definition ever is debatable, but I think most of us would agree it is a good attempt to explain what a decision is. So what do other (more official) sources say about it?

According to [Cambridge dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/decision), a decision is:

```
a choice that you make about something after thinking about several possibilities.
```

and here is another one, from the texbook [Foundations of Decision Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Decision-Analysis-Ronald-Howard/dp/0132336243/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3BHQUJF5YW9PC&keywords=foundations+of+decision+analysis&qid=1570889458&s=books&sprefix=foundations+of+deci%2Caps%2C234&sr=1-1):

```
Decision:
a choice between two or more alternatives that involves an irrevocable allocation of resources.
```

Although the definitions seem very different at first glance, they do have a couple of key concepts in common.

### Alternatives

To start with, the concept of `multiple things you can select from are available for the same decision`. Whether it is called an `option`, a `possibility` or an `alternative`, they all try to express the same concept:

a path that will lead to a different outcome. Or to use the definition of the textbook:

```
available courses of action that the person believes would lead to different futures.
```



### Resources

And secondly, you have to boil them down to one.

## A decision can be ...

... Easy or hard


What makes a decision easy or hard is how well informed you feel about the decision you have to make.
Picking your ice cream flavor can be labelled as an easy decision. 

... Reactive or proactive

... good or bad
