The word `decision` pops up very often in our day to day conversations, and that is not that surprising. Decisions form a very central role in our lives: we can easily sum up someones life by telling the sequence of decisions they made throughout it. We judge ourselves and other people by the decisions that we make:

* I can't believe they are moving in together, that is just a nightmare waiting to happen...
* You should ask your brother to go with when buying your car, he bought a really good one himself.


The sad thing is that most of us never really learn anything about making decisions. <!--more--> So a few years ago, when a friend onf mine told me that they actually taught this in certain courses

Let's start by trying to answer a very basic question: what exactly is a decision?

## What is a decision?

If I had to explain a decision to someone unfamiliar with the concept, this is what I would say:

```
You have to do something, and there a few options you could pick to do it and you need to pick just one of them.
```

Whether it is the best definition ever is debatable, but I think most of us would agree it is a good attempt to explain what a decision is. So what do other (more official) sources say about it?

According to [Cambridge dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/decision), a decision is:

```
a choice that you make about something after thinking about several possibilities.
```

and here is another one, from the texbook [Foundations of Decision Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Decision-Analysis-Ronald-Howard/dp/0132336243/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3BHQUJF5YW9PC&keywords=foundations+of+decision+analysis&qid=1570889458&s=books&sprefix=foundations+of+deci%2Caps%2C234&sr=1-1):

```
Decision:
a choice between two or more alternatives that involves an irrevocable allocation of resources.
```



There are a couple of key concepts here: `two or more alternatives` and `irrevocable allocation of resources`. But what exactly do those two mean?

### Alternatives


### Resources



## A decision can be ...

... Easy or hard



... Reactive or proactive

... good or bad
