The word `decision` pops up very often in our day to day conversations, and that is not that surprising. Decisions form a very central role in our lives: we can easily sum up someones life by telling the sequence of decisions they made throughout it. We judge ourselves and other people by the decisions that we make:

Abbas, Ali E.; Howard, Ronald A.. Foundations of Decision Analysis, Global Edition (Page 30).  . Kindle Edition.

... Reactive or proactive

... good or bad
