## What is a decision?

According to [Oxford dictionary](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/decision), a decision is:

```
A conclusion or resolution reached after consideration.
‘I'll make the decision on my own’
‘the editor's decision is final’

    1.1 [mass noun] The action or process of deciding something or of resolving a question.
    ‘the information was used as the basis for decision’

    1.2 [mass noun] The ability or tendency to make decisions quickly; decisiveness.
    ‘she was a woman of decision’
```

But how can you be sure somebody made a decision? Simple stating it does not make it true.
