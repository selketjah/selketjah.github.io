The hardest part about programming is people.

Well, that might be a bit exaggerated, but 'How do I deal with person X or behavior Y in my company?' is a question that often pops up during meetups or (un)conferences. Apparantly, a lot of developers struggle with the people part of programming, and I am no exception.
That is why I started reading up on it. In the end communication, conflict handling and all such are just skills that we need to
practice to get better at it.

How to win friends and influence people is an 'oldie but goodie'. It was first published in 1936, but still totally worth reading as far
as I'm concerned. :-)
