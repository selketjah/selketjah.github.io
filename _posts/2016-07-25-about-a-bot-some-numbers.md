In the beginning of this year, I did an F# mentorship with Mathias Brandewinder.

If you want the quick version of the general setup of the mentorship, you are in the right place!
This is just a summary with little detail as a future reference point for those who read the entire thing.
You can find the full story [here](http://selketjah.github.io/2016/07/24/about-a-bot-start/).

<!--more-->

## 1
Duration of each session.
Also the number of finished projects in F# after the mentorship (yes, finished!)

## 2
Number of people involved
This is also the number of retrospectives we did.

## 4
Number of weeks getting into the F# 'groove'.

## 6
Number of weeks working on a real project (More about that later)

## 5
Minimum amount of hours doing my homework, (or hours spend preparing for the next session.)

## 9
time zone difference. Settle quickly on a fixed moment to do the sessions to overcome struggling with it.

## 10
Number of sessions

## 15
Maximum of hours spend doing my homework.

## Infinite
Amount of suffering we had trying to find the right tools for the job. In the end we settled for TeamViewer
for screen collaboration and Skype for audio/video.

## 42
If you have any questions about the mentorship, please feel free to contact me via Twitter (or other means)

If you would like to participate in one, you are lucky! The F# community also organizes mentorships!
more info can be found [here](http://fsharp.org/mentorship/about.html) Next round will start somewhere in September.
