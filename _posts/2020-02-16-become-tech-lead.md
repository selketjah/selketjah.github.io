It is time for my first book review of 2020!

A while back someone told me that they saw potential in me to take on a leadership function, but I needed to learn to communication in different styles. Although I appreciated the input, I had one problem: I don't know any other communication styles than my current one... Even worse, I don't fully understand my current communication style and the impact it has on different people.

So, I started reading some different books on communication, but I just couldn't motivate myself to keep reading it. Then I remembered a friend of mine talking about `Becoming a technical leader` and how great they thought the book was. I can only say one thing: they were right. Every chapter has a `Question` section with thoughtful questions so you can start looking into who you are and how you lead. Besides that, it offers some wonderful advice on how to be a better leader, including how you communicate with other people.

### Chapter 2. Models of Leadership Style
 > If we look more closely at how technical leaders emphasize innovation, we ﬁnd that they concentrate on three major areas: 
 > • understanding the problem 
 > • managing the ﬂow of ideas 
 > • maintaining quality (Location 438)

### Chapter 3. A Problem-Solving Style
 > Effective leaders build continuous testing of their own understanding into their work . They are self - conﬁdent, but realistic about their own intellectual limitations. (Location 517)
<br>

 > Drop one’s own idea in favor of an idea the team wants to develop, and Refuse to let an idea drop until everyone understands it. (Location 536)
 <br>

 > Resist time pressure, and take the time to listen when other people explain their ideas. (Location 544)
 <br>

 > Withhold quick criticism of teammates ’ ideas, in order to keep the ideas ﬂowing. (Location 553)
 <br>

 > When you must criticize an idea, make clear that you are criticizing the idea, not the person who offered the idea. (Location 558)
 <br>

 > When time and labor are running short, stop working on new ideas and just pitch in. (Location 566)
 <br>

 > Encourage the team to drop ideas that had succeeded earlier, but cannot be extended to the new situation. (Location 569)
 <br>

 > Revive a dropped idea later, when it has value for another part of the problem. (Location 572)
 <br>

 > Design tools and processes to measure quality as you build a solution. (Location 581)
 <br>

 > Measure the speed of implementation, compare it to the schedule, and be prepared to change the solution procedure. (Location 585)
 <br>

 > Step back from the project to refresh your perspective and to assess its viability. (Location 587)
 <br>

 > Check ideas with the customer before implementing them. (Location 591)

### Chapter 6. The Three Great Obstacles to Innovation
 > Don’t ever volunteer your observations about people
 > Even when people ask for your observations, they won’t always like what you have to say. (Location 943 - 944)

### Chapter 10. The First Great Obstacle to Motivating Others
 > We tend to think that our messages are perfectly clear, but you can generally assume something will be lost in every reception. (Location 1493)
  <br>

 > Perception: Neither of us perceives even the manifest part in the same way
 > Wrong time: The transformation refers to things in the past or future, things that have no logical bearing on the present communication.
 > Wrong place: The transformation refers to some other context.
 > Wrong person: The transformation refers to some other person.
 > Self-worth: My feelings about myself have a powerful inﬂuence on how I respond, but you have no direct access to how I feel about myself (Location 1555 - 1563)
  <br>

 > Tell them what you perceive, how you feel about what you perceive, and if possible how you feel about that feeling. (Location 1579)

### Chapter 11. The Second Great Obstacle to Motivating Others
 > When I’m ﬁnished with them, do they care less about the subject? (Location 1660)
 <br>

 > If you can’t do the task without exploiting people, perhaps you shouldn’t do it at all. (Location 1679)

### Chapter 12. The Problem of Helping Others
 > Programming team leaders are promoted according to their technical skills, with the assumption that any normal person will be able to pick up leadership skills along the way. (Location 1743)
 <br>

 > Wanting to help people may be a noble motive but that doesn’t make it any easier. (Location 1811)
 <br>

 > If people don’t want your help, you’ll never succeed in helping them, no matter how smart or wonderful you are. (Location 1814)
 <br>

 > Effective help can only start with mutual agreement on a clear deﬁnition of the problem. (Location 1818)
 <br>

 > Always check whether they want your help. (Location 1823)
 <br>

 > Even when people agree that they want your help, that agreement is not usually a lifetime contract. (Location 1827)
 <br>

 > They don’t seem to realize that every offer to help is intended to do something for the helper. There are very few living saints. (Location 1830)
 <br>

 > Most people understand that helpers are selﬁsh, but also think they are exceptions to the rule. (Location 1838)
 <br>

 > Attempts to help are often interpreted as attempts to interfere. (Location 1841)
 <br>

 > No matter how strange it may look, most people are actually trying to be helpful. (Location 1843)

### Chapter 15. Power, Imperfection, and Congruence
 > If everyone wants so intensely to do good, how can so many people be doing such a miserable job? (Location 2135)
 <br>

 > Maturity is, rather, a statistical collection of behaviors, behaviors we can improve a little at a time. (Location 2174)

### Chapter 24. Finding Support for Change
 > Whenever you try to change, some of the people you know will try to prevent you from changing. (Location 3369)
