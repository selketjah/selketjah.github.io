## Pragmatic Thinking and Learning by Andy Hunt

About one and a half years ago I read the book ‘Pragmatic Thinking and Learning: Refactor Your Wetware’ by Andy Hunt.

About 75 percent of the tips and tricks from the book I still apply today, which is a first.

I hope my first attempt in creating a summary of a book (as you can see, creating mind maps is one of them) is a good teaser 
to read the book yourself.
