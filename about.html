                <p>
                    Thanks for reading my blog!
                    My name is Gien and I have been programming in C# for most of my career. Recently I added F# to that list and loving it.
                </p>

                I always start my day with coffee, I'm part of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/dddbelgium/">@DDDBE</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/socratesbe/">@SoCraTes_BE</a> organisational team 
                and I help out with the <a href="http://www.socratesbe.org/">SoCraTes BE conference</a>.
                    
                If I'm not busy with becoming a better developer, you will find me on the sofa, reading (yes, with coffee).
