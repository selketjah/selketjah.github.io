                    Thanks for reading my blog!

                    My name is Gien and I was a software developer for 13 years, programming in both OOP and FP languages, mostly in .NET. Now I focus on strategic software decisions and domain modelling. 
                    Recently I started working as a senior consultant for a company called <a href="http://www.aardling.eu">Aardling</a> and loving it.

                    As a Domain-Driven Design practitioner, I look to bridge the gaps between experts, users, and engineers.
                    As a side interest, I am researching the science of decision-making strategies, to help teams improve how they make technical and 
                    organisational decisions. I share what I know by speaking and teaching at international conferences. 
                </p>

                    And when I am not doing all that, you'll find me on the sofa, reading a book and sipping coffee.
