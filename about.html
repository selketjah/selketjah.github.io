                    Thanks for reading my blog!
                    My name is Gien and I was a software developer for 13 years, programming in both OOP and FP languages. Now I focus on strategic software decisions and domain modelling. Recently I started working as a consultant for a company called <a href="http://www.aardling.eu">Aardling</a> and loving it.

                    I always start my day with coffee, I'm part of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/dddbelgium/">@DDDBE</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/socratesbe/">@SoCraTes_BE</a> organisational team 
                    and I help out at <a href="https://dddeurope.com/">DDD Europe</a>.
                        
                    If I'm not busy with becoming a better person, you will find me on the sofa, reading (yes, with coffee).
