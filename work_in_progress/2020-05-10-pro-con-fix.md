## What is a PRO-CON-FIX list?

The PRO-CON-FIX list has a very simple format. It is a table with three columns. 

First you write down all the positive aspects of the option, all the things you will gain when you pick it. Then you write down all the negative aspects of the option.

## When do you use it?

I noticed that a PRO-CON-FIX list works best when you are trying to decide between two possibilities which are each others opposites. 

## Example



| PRO           | CON           | FIXES |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

## Tips and tricks

With one possibility, I mean is a yes or no decision about one topic: yes or no on taking THIS job, yes or no on buying THIS car etc...You have two options, but there is only one list you have to create.

## Pitfalls


1. You are comparing lists, not items on the list

Something I have noticed when working with a PRO-CON-FIX list, is that it is very tempting to compare items on a list, instead of comparing the lists.

Another thing I noticed is that the lists are created in comparison to each other. An example: "We will have more flexibility". More than what?
Words such as "more", "less", "faster"... are good indications that you are not thinking about the positive and negative aspects of the topic in isolation. The right question is "How much flexibility will we gain with this option?" and write the answer down.
